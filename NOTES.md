Here is the things I would like to do:
- Clean up the code more following design principles, where I couldn't able to follow.
- Will write unit tests for the class I wrote.
- Will add **[PHP Coding Standards Fixer](https://github.com/PHP-CS-Fixer/PHP-CS-Fixer)** to maintain PSR-12 PHP coding standard.
- etc...
